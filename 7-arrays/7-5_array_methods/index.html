<h1>Array Methods</h1>
<p>The <b>join()</b> method takes an array and returns a string with all the items in the array
    separated by a supplied character, such as comma or a colon.
    This is a great way to display all the items in an array in a single line.</p>
<p>Another useful method is <b>concat()</b>. It can be used to add one list to another.</p>
<p>The <b>indexOf()</b> method lets to search an array for a particular value. If the value is in
    the list, than that element's position is returned. However, if the item is not in the list,
    then the indexOf() method returns the value -1.</p>
<p>Full arrays' methods list can be found on MDN: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array">Arrays methods</a>.</p>
